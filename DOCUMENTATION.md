# AutoCode: Reddit Promo Agent

## Project Overview

AutoCode: Reddit Promo Agent is an automated tool designed to promote the AutoCode product on Reddit
through targeted interactions and creative posts. The project utilizes AI-powered content
generation, Reddit API integration, and scheduled tasks to create an efficient and engaging
promotional strategy.

## Architecture Description

The project follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Main Script (reddit.js)**: Orchestrates the overall functionality, including Reddit
   interactions, scheduling, and task management.
2. **AI Content Generation (claude.js)**: Integrates with the Claude AI model to generate
   personalized and context-aware content.
3. **Configuration Management (config.js)**: Centralizes all configuration settings for easy
   customization.
4. **Environment Variables (.env)**: Stores sensitive information and API keys securely.

### Key Technologies and Libraries

-   Node.js
-   snoowrap (Reddit API wrapper)
-   node-schedule (Task scheduling)
-   winston (Logging)
-   dotenv (Environment variable management)
-   @anthropic-ai/sdk (Claude AI integration)
-   limiter (Rate limiting)
-   node-cache (Caching)

## Module Interactions

1. **reddit.js**:

    - Initializes the Reddit API client using snoowrap
    - Sets up scheduled tasks using node-schedule
    - Manages rate limiting and caching
    - Calls functions from claude.js for content generation
    - Handles error logging and retries

2. **claude.js**:

    - Provides functions for generating various types of content (posts, comments, analysis)
    - Integrates with the Claude AI model using the Anthropic SDK
    - Implements content optimization and scoring

3. **config.js**:
    - Exports a configuration object used throughout the application
    - Defines settings for the product, target subreddits, interaction limits, and more

## Features

1. **Post Interaction**: Automatically finds and comments on relevant posts in target subreddits.
2. **Content Creation**: Generates creative posts and personalized content for different subreddits.
3. **Scheduling**: Uses node-schedule to run daily tasks at specified times.
4. **Reddit API Integration**: Utilizes snoowrap for seamless interaction with the Reddit API.
5. **Claude AI Integration**: Leverages the Claude AI model for intelligent content generation.
6. **Configuration Management**: Centralizes all settings in a single configuration file.
7. **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting to comply with Reddit's API usage guidelines.
8. **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
9. **Content Personalization**: Generates subreddit-specific content based on popular keywords.
10. **Analytics**: Tracks post performance and provides analysis.
11. **Multilingual Support**: Can generate content in multiple languages (if enabled).
12. **Caching**: Implements caching for improved performance and reduced API calls.
13. **Special Content Generation**: Creates weekly updates with industry news, code snippets, and
    more.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autocode-reddit-promo-agent.git
    cd autocode-reddit-promo-agent
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

    ```
    CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
    REDDIT_USERNAME=your_reddit_username
    REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_reddit_password
    CLAUDE_KEY=your_claude_api_key
    ```

4. Customize the `config.js` file to match your product details and target subreddits.

## Usage

To start the Reddit Promo Agent:

```
npm start
```

This will initiate the scheduled tasks and begin the automated Reddit interactions.

## Configuration

The `config.js` file contains various settings that can be adjusted:

-   `product`: Details about the product being promoted
-   `mainSubreddit`: The primary subreddit for promotional activities
-   `targetSubreddits`: List of subreddits to target for interactions
-   `keywordsToTrack`: Keywords to look for in posts
-   `keywordsToInject`: Keywords to include in generated content
-   `postSchedule`: Timing for scheduled posts
-   `interactionLimits`: Rate limiting settings
-   `contentGeneration`: Parameters for content creation
-   `apiConfig`: Reddit API configuration
-   `claudeConfig`: Settings for the Claude AI model

## Logging

The application uses Winston for logging. Logs are written to both the console and log files:

-   `promo-agent.log`: General application logs
-   `error.log`: Error-specific logs

## Error Handling and Retries

The application implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling transient errors.
This is particularly useful for API calls that may fail due to network issues or rate limiting.

## Security Considerations

-   API keys and credentials are stored in environment variables, not in the code.
-   The application refreshes the Reddit access token periodically to maintain secure access.

## Ethical Considerations

The `config.js` file includes settings for ethical AI use, such as transparency and responsible
content guidelines. It's important to use this tool responsibly and in compliance with Reddit's
terms of service.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development include:

-   Expanding multi-platform support
-   Implementing more advanced NLP and machine learning capabilities
-   Developing a user interface for easier management
-   Enhancing analytics and reporting features
