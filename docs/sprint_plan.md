Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Implement core Reddit integration and basic content generation functionality to enable automated
posting and interaction on specified subreddits.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

### High Priority

1. Implement basic Reddit API integration (8 points)

    - Authenticate with Reddit API
    - Create posts in specified subreddits
    - Handle rate limiting and error responses

2. Develop Claude Sonnet integration for content generation (5 points)

    - Set up Claude Sonnet API connection
    - Create prompts for generating post titles and content
    - Implement error handling and fallback options

3. Create configuration management system (3 points)

    - Develop `config.js` to store centralized settings
    - Include product details, target subreddits, and posting frequency

4. Implement post interaction functionality (5 points)
    - Develop logic to find and engage with relevant posts
    - Create comment generation using Claude Sonnet

### Medium Priority

5. Design and implement scheduling system (5 points)

    - Create a mechanism for scheduling daily posts
    - Ensure compliance with Reddit's posting rules and rate limits

6. Develop basic dashboard for analytics (8 points)

    - Create a simple web interface to display key metrics
    - Implement user authentication for dashboard access

7. Enhance error handling and logging (3 points)
    - Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application
    - Set up logging system for debugging and monitoring

## Estimated Total Effort

37 story points

## Dependencies and Risks

-   Reddit API credentials and Claude Sonnet API key must be obtained before starting tasks 1 and 2
-   Task 6 (dashboard) depends on the completion of tasks 1-5 to have meaningful data to display
-   Risk: Reddit API changes or rate limit adjustments may impact functionality
-   Risk: Claude Sonnet API performance or availability issues could affect content generation

## Definition of Done

-   All code is written, reviewed, and merged into the main branch
-   Unit tests are written and passing for each new feature
-   Integration tests are performed to ensure components work together
-   Documentation is updated to reflect new features and usage instructions
-   The application can successfully:
    -   Authenticate with Reddit
    -   Generate content using Claude Sonnet
    -   Post to specified subreddits according to the configured schedule
    -   Interact with relevant posts
    -   Display basic analytics on the dashboard
-   All selected tasks are completed and meet acceptance criteria
-   The application runs without critical errors in a staging environment
```

This sprint plan focuses on implementing the core functionality of the Reddit Promo Agent,
prioritizing the essential features for posting, content generation, and basic analytics. The
selected tasks cover the high-priority items from the backlog and include one medium-priority item
(the dashboard) to provide immediate value to users. The additional task for error handling and
logging addresses a critical aspect of software development and will contribute to the overall
stability and maintainability of the application.
