## Notes

- The high-priority items focus on establishing core functionality for Reddit interaction, content generation, and basic scheduling.
- Medium-priority items aim to enhance the tool's effectiveness and scalability.
- Low-priority items are focused on advanced features that can be developed once the core functionality is stable.
- As development progresses, priorities may shift based on user feedback and performance data.
```

This updated backlog reflects the current project state, focusing on implementing core features first while planning for more advanced functionality in the future. The priorities have been adjusted to ensure a solid foundation is built before moving on to more complex features.
