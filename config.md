# config.js Documentation

## Overview

`config.js` is a crucial configuration file for the AutoCode project. It exports a default object
containing various settings and parameters that control the behavior of the application. This file
plays a central role in defining the project's features, API interactions, content generation rules,
and other operational aspects.

## File Structure

The configuration object is organized into several main sections:

1. Product information
2. Reddit-related settings
3. Content generation parameters
4. API configuration
5. Error handling and logging
6. Analytics and security
7. Feature flags
8. AI and NLP settings
9. Performance and optimization
10. Ethical AI considerations
11. Multi-platform and user interaction settings

## Key Sections

### Product Information

```javascript
product: {
    name: 'AutoCode',
    description: '...',
    advantages: [...]
}
```

This section defines the product name, a detailed markdown description, and key advantages of
AutoCode.

### Reddit Settings

```javascript
mainSubreddit: 'AutoCode',
targetSubreddits: [...],
keywordsToTrack: [...],
keywordsToInject: [...],
postSchedule: {...},
interactionLimits: {...}
```

These settings control the Reddit-specific behavior, including target subreddits, keywords for
tracking and injection, posting schedule, and interaction limits.

### Content Generation

```javascript
contentGeneration: {
    minLength: 100,
    maxLength: 500,
    useKeywords: true,
    keywordDensity: 0.02
}
```

Defines parameters for generating content, including length constraints and keyword usage.

### API Configuration

```javascript
apiConfig: {
    baseUrl: 'https://oauth.reddit.com',
    version: 'v1',
    userAgent: 'Reddit Promo Agent v1.0.0'
}
```

Specifies the API endpoint and user agent for Reddit interactions.

### Error Handling and Logging

```javascript
errorHandling: {...},
logging: {...}
```

Configures error retry mechanisms and logging preferences.

### Analytics and Security

```javascript
analytics: {...},
security: {...}
```

Sets up engagement tracking and token refresh intervals.

### Feature Flags

```javascript
features: {
    postInteraction: true,
    contentCreation: true,
    // ... other features
}
```

Enables or disables various features of the application.

### AI and NLP Settings

```javascript
claudeConfig: {...},
nlp: {...},
machineLearning: {...}
```

Configures AI model parameters and NLP/ML features.

### Performance and Optimization

```javascript
performanceOptimization: {...},
caching: {...}
```

Defines caching and database optimization settings.

### Ethical AI

```javascript
ethicalAI: {
    transparencyEnabled: true,
    responsibleContentGuidelines: true
}
```

Ensures ethical AI practices are followed.

## Usage

To use this configuration in other parts of the project, import it as follows:

```javascript
import config from './config.js';

// Access configuration values
console.log(config.product.name);
console.log(config.apiConfig.baseUrl);
```

## Modifying the Configuration

When changes to the configuration are needed:

1. Open `config.js`
2. Locate the relevant section
3. Modify the values as required
4. Save the file

Note: Ensure that any changes made are consistent with the project's requirements and do not break
existing functionality.

## Integration with Other Files

-   `claude.js` likely uses the `claudeConfig` settings for AI interactions
-   `reddit.js` probably utilizes the Reddit-specific settings and API configuration
-   The root-level `.prettierrc` file may influence code formatting in this and other JavaScript
    files

## Conclusion

`config.js` serves as the central configuration hub for the AutoCode project, allowing easy
customization of various aspects of the application's behavior without modifying core logic in other
files.
